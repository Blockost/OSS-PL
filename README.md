# OSS-PL 

![Jean Dujardin (alias Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blockost/OSS-PL/master/thumbnail.jpg "From OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies")

Programming language based on one-liners from OSS 117 French comic movies. 
This project is heavily inspired by [ArnoldC](https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC)

## Getting started
Here's a sample of the simplest program you can do in OSS:

    Bienvenue en Egypt 117: "Hello World!"

## Transpiler
This programming language is actually transpiled into `Javascript` by a NodeJs
back-end responsible for parsing the code structure and executing the
statements.
