# OSS-PL
Programming language based on famous OSS 117 French comic movies

## Getting started
Here's a sample of the simplest program you can do in OSS:

    Bienvenue en Egypt 117: "Hello World!"

## Transpiler
This programming language is actually transpiled into `Javascript` by a NodeJs
server responsible for parsing the code structure and executing the
statements.
